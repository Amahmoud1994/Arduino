# Arduino

I put some examples and libraries that I faced during my work on Arduino. 
# The examples are NOT for all boards.
Each board has its own examples/libraries and you can find different boards/kits/shields from this link:

You can download Arduino from this link:

You will find the Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger library as ceprate repo (https://github.com/Amahmoud1994/Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger)

# Note
Some of the programs are mine and others are not. 
You may find some errors when you compile a certain program so just be sure that you have downloaded the required drivers and libraries you need for your Board.
I was working with arduino UNO board.
